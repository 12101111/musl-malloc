included version has been heavily modified by Rich Felker in 2012, in
the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace cleanliness.

The implementation of DES for crypt (src/misc/crypt.c) is Copyright ©

All files which have no copyright comments are original works
Copyright © 2005-2012 Rich Felker, the main author of this library.
The decision to exclude such comments is intentional, as it should be
possible to carry around the complete source code on tiny storage
media. All public header files (include/*) should be treated as Public
Domain as they intentionally contain no content which can be covered
by copyright. Some source modules may fall in this category as well.
If you believe that a file is so trivial that it should be in the
Public Domain, please contact me and, if I agree, I will explicitly
release it from copyright.

The following files are trivial, in my opinion not copyrightable in
the first place, and hereby explicitly released to the Public Domain:

All public headers: include/*
Startup files: crt/*
