This directory is a skeleton for upcoming merge of musl's new malloc
implementation, mallocng. To use it, drop in copies of or symlinks to
the following files from mallocng:

- meta.h
- malloc.c
- realloc.c
- free.c
- aligned_alloc.c
- malloc_usable_size.c

and build with make variable MALLOC_DIR=mallocng in config.mak or on
make command line.
